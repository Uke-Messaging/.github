# uke - compose your message

## Abstract

Uke is a p2p, completely distributed messaging protocol. 
It utilizes local cryptography and a Substrate blockchain instance to verify, send, and receive messages in real time - just like any other conventional messaging protocol, and can be used to construct messaging apps, or any other application in which real time messaging is needed.


## Goals & Values

Uke aims to be the global, web3 standard for messaging and communication. It has a few primary goals and standards to upkeep:

1. Privacy - each message sent is completely, and purely, peer to peer - no one else can intercept or decrypt the message.

2. Fault Tolerance / Reliability - By using DLT, we remove the need for a central server, meaning as long as an amount of nodes are kept online, users can still talk to one another.  This is especially useful in emergency scenarios, as users can even opt to run their own nodes to ensure 100% runtime.

3. Anonymity - since each user is essentially just a cryptographic key paired with an id, user’s can easily stay anonymous on and off chain if they so wish to choose.
